# single cell joint profiling of chromatin and RNA expression in 3rd Trimester Human Fetal Brain Samples (QualsProposalNE.pdf)
## Here I first set up the experiment SHARE-seq https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0092867420312538 technology in mESCs
## I then set up the analysis pipeline to demutiplex libraries and get simultaneous readout of single cell RNA and ATAC
